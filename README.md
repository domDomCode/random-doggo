# Hello!

This is a tiny bootstrapped app that randomly displays an image of a doggo (or if you're lucky, a cute lil pupper).

Written in React + Typescript, with Material UI to make everything simpler.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### docker-compose up -d --build
App is containerized - it exposes port 3001 externally.

### yarn start
Traditional way to start a development server.
